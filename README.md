# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification
Project Title: Iris Flower Classification  Overview: This project builds a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on sepal and petal length and width. Using the Iris dataset (150 samples), the model predicts species based on flower measurements. It employs various model.




#### **Project Title:**
Iris Flower Classification

#### **Project Overview:**
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. The classification is based on four key features of the flowers:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The objective is to train a machine learning model on the famous Iris dataset, enabling it to predict the species of a flower given its measurements.

#### **Dataset:**
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning community. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a label indicating the species.

- **Source:** The dataset can be loaded from scikit-learnâ€™s `datasets` module.

#### **Key Features of the Project:**
1. **Data Exploration & Visualization:** 
   - Exploring the dataset to understand the relationships between features.
   - Visualizing the data using techniques like pair plots and histograms.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing data (if any).
   - Normalizing or standardizing features as needed.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Training various machine learning models such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Random Forests
   - Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Cross-validation for performance consistency.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Training the model on the Iris dataset.
   - Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. **Prediction & Evaluation:**
   - Testing the model on unseen data and evaluating its performance.
   - Visualizing the confusion matrix to understand classification accuracy.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Saving the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle` for future use.
   - Optional: Deploying the model using Flask/Django for real-time predictions.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries/Tools:**
  - scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
  - pandas (for data manipulation)
  - seaborn & matplotlib (for data visualization)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)

#### **Usage Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

#### **Future Work:**
- Implementing more advanced models such as neural networks.
- Exploring more feature engineering techniques.
- Improving model performance through additional hyperparameter tuning.
